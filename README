To run:
Download Play framework version 1.1.
Define the environment variable PLAY_HOME to the directory that contains PLAY.
Include PLAY_HOME in PATH.
(e.g. export PLAY_HOME=$HOME/play-1.1; export PATH=$PATH:$PLAY_HOME)

From the directory that contains this README-file, run play install maven.
This installs a maven module we will use later. 
Then run play mvn:install and wait for the dependencies to download. 
Then run play mvn:refresh to have the depencies copied to the lib/ folder.
Now you can start the webapp by executing 'play run'.

IDEA-instructions:
o Import pom file.
o In module settings, choose dependencies, then add, then jar directory, choose the lib/ folder
