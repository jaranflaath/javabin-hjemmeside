To run:
Download Play framework version 1.1 fra http://www.playframework.org/
Define the environment variable PLAY_HOME to the directory that contains PLAY.
Include PLAY_HOME in PATH.
(e.g. export PLAY_HOME=$HOME/play-1.1; export PATH=$PATH:$PLAY_HOME)


From the directory that contains this README-file, run:
'play install playapps'
'play install pdf'
'play install maven'

This installs a maven module we will use later. (Maven 2.2 or newer must be installed and in PATH.) 
Then run 'play mvn:install' and wait for the dependencies to download. 
Then run 'play mvn:refresh' to have the depencies copied to the lib/ folder.
Now you can start the webapp by executing 'play run'.

IDEA-instructions:
o Import pom file.
o In module settings, choose dependencies, then add, then library, java, jar directory, choose the lib/ folder. Also add framework/ and framework/lib from the play folder.
